College Feedback Classifier
Project Overview
The "College Feedback Classifier" is an innovative machine learning project designed to revolutionize how colleges manage and respond to student feedback. In any large educational institution, feedback from students is invaluable for continuous improvement across various departments. However, manually sorting and routing this feedback can be a time-consuming and inefficient process. Our system addresses this challenge by automatically categorizing incoming student feedback, ensuring it reaches the correct department quickly and efficiently. This streamlined approach aims to enhance the responsiveness of college administration, improve student satisfaction, and foster a more proactive environment for addressing concerns.

Key Features
Automated Categorization: The core functionality of our system is to automatically classify feedback into specific, actionable categories:

Administration Office

Hostel

Academics

Labs

IT Services

Facilities

Uncategorized: For feedback that doesn't clearly fit into the predefined categories, ensuring no feedback is lost and can be manually reviewed.

Enhanced Efficiency: By eliminating the need for manual sorting, the system significantly reduces the time and effort required to direct feedback, allowing departments to focus on addressing issues rather than routing them.

Improved Responsiveness: Faster classification leads to quicker responses to student concerns, fostering a more positive and supportive college environment.

Scalable Solution: Built to handle a high volume of feedback submissions, making it suitable for institutions of all sizes.

Technologies Used
Our project leverages a robust set of modern machine learning and development tools:

IDE / Platform: Google Colab - Provides a powerful, cloud-based environment for developing and running our Python code, with free access to GPUs.

Foundation Model: FLAN-T5 Base (google/flan-t5-base) - A highly effective large language model from Google, chosen for its strong performance in various NLP tasks, particularly few-shot learning.

Libraries:

transformers: Essential for interacting with the FLAN-T5 model and other pre-trained NLP models.

pandas: Used extensively for data manipulation and analysis, especially for handling feedback data in tabular formats.

File Handling: CSV upload/download via google.colab.files - Facilitates easy input of feedback datasets and output of classified results directly within the Colab environment.

NLP Technique: Few-shot prompting with instruction tuning - This advanced technique allows our model to learn to classify feedback effectively with only a small number of examples, making the training process efficient and adaptable.

Post-processing: Keyword-based fallback classification - Implements a secondary classification layer that uses keywords to categorize feedback that the primary model might not have confidently assigned, improving accuracy and reducing uncategorized items.

Optional Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn (if added later) - These libraries can be integrated to create insightful visualizations of feedback trends, category distribution, and system performance, aiding in further analysis and decision-making.

How it Works
The College Feedback Classifier operates by taking raw student feedback as input. It then employs the powerful FLAN-T5 Base model, fine-tuned with few-shot prompting and instruction tuning, to understand the context and sentiment of the feedback. Based on this understanding, the model assigns the feedback to the most appropriate department category. A subsequent keyword-based fallback classification step acts as a safety net, ensuring even nuanced or ambiguous feedback is accurately routed. Any feedback that cannot be confidently classified by either method is marked as "Uncategorized" for manual review, ensuring no feedback is ever overlooked.
